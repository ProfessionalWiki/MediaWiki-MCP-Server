This is an exceptionally thorough and well-structured bug report! You have demonstrated strong analytical thinking, systematic problem-solving, and clear communication. Let me provide feedback and ask some clarifying questions to help ensure the most effective resolution.

## Strengths of Your Analysis

Your diagnostic approach is excellent - you've correctly identified the root cause as URL concatenation issues in the `utils.ts` file, and your proposed fix using the "clean then combine" strategy is sound. The step-by-step action plan shows good project management thinking, and the Feynman technique explanation demonstrates you understand the problem deeply enough to explain it simply.

## Questions to Strengthen Your Approach

Before you proceed with the implementation, I'd like to understand a few things better:

**About the Current State:**

1. Have you actually confirmed that `wikiServer()` returns a URL with a trailing slash? Your hypothesis mentions this as likely, but it would be valuable to know if you've verified this assumption through any means other than the console.log approach that isn't working.

2. What does your current MediaWiki configuration look like? Specifically, what values are you expecting for `wikiServer()` and `scriptPath()` in your setup?

**About Your Debugging Strategy:** 3. Since the console.log capture isn't working as expected, have you considered alternative debugging approaches? For instance, could you temporarily modify the code to write debug information to a file, or add error handling that would reveal the malformed URLs in error messages?

4. When you mention "Despite attempts to capture console.log output" - are you running the server in stdio mode as an MCP server, or as a standalone process? This distinction might explain why standard output redirection isn't working as expected.

**About Your Proposed Solution:** 5. Your fix looks comprehensive, but I'm curious about one edge case: what happens if `scriptPath()` returns something like `/w/` (with both leading and trailing slashes) and your cleaning process removes both? Will this still produce the correct path structure for MediaWiki installations that expect the script path to be preserved?

6. Have you considered whether there might be other places in the codebase where similar URL construction issues could exist, beyond the three `makeRest*Request` functions you've identified?

**About Testing and Verification:** 7. Once you implement the fix, how will you test edge cases like empty script paths, root-level MediaWiki installations, or unusual domain configurations? Do you have access to different MediaWiki setups for testing?

## Suggestions for Enhancement

Your approach is solid, but here are some thoughts that might make it even more robust:

**Consider a Utility Function:** Instead of repeating the URL cleaning logic in three different functions, you might want to create a dedicated `buildRestApiUrl()` utility function. This would centralize the logic and make future maintenance easier.

**URL Constructor Alternative:** JavaScript's built-in `URL` constructor is designed to handle exactly these kinds of path concatenation issues. You might consider whether using `new URL(path, base)` could simplify your solution and make it more standards-compliant.

**Comprehensive Logging:** Since debugging output is crucial for this type of issue, consider implementing a more robust logging system that writes to files or uses a logging library, rather than relying on console.log.

Your methodical approach and clear documentation are exemplary. The main thing I'd encourage is gathering that runtime data first (perhaps through alternative debugging methods if console capture continues to fail) to confirm your hypotheses before implementing the fix. This will give you confidence that you're solving the right problem in the right way.

What are your thoughts on these questions, and do you have any alternative approaches for gathering the runtime URL values if the console logging continues to be problematic?
