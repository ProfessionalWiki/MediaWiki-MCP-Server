Your response shows excellent receptiveness to feedback and demonstrates that you're thinking systematically about this problem. I'm impressed by how you've integrated the suggestions while maintaining focus on your original debugging strategy. Let me offer some additional guidance as you move forward.

**Regarding Your Debugging Approach**

Your plan to use `npm start > mcp.log 2>&1 &` is sound, but I want to help you understand why the stdio mode might be complicating things. When an MCP server runs in stdio mode, it's designed to communicate through standard input and output with its parent process (like Claude or another MCP client). This means that console.log statements might be getting mixed with or suppressed by the MCP protocol messages.

Here's a more targeted debugging strategy that might work better: instead of relying on console.log, consider temporarily modifying the error handling in your fetch functions to include the malformed URL in the error message itself. This way, when the request fails, the error response will contain the exact URL that was constructed, and this will be visible in the MCP response that gets returned to the client.

**About the URL Constructor Suggestion**

I'm glad you're enthusiastic about using JavaScript's URL constructor! Let me walk you through how this could simplify your approach significantly. Instead of manually cleaning and concatenating strings, you could do something like this:

```javascript
// Start with the base server URL
const baseUrl = new URL(wikiServer());

// Add script path if it exists
if (scriptPath()) {
  baseUrl.pathname =
    baseUrl.pathname + scriptPath().replace(/^\/|\/$/g, "") + "/";
}

// Add the rest.php endpoint
baseUrl.pathname = baseUrl.pathname + "rest.php/" + path.replace(/^\//, "");
```

This approach leverages the URL constructor's built-in handling of path normalization, which should eliminate the double-slash issue entirely.

**A Strategic Question About Your Next Steps**

Before you proceed with step 1, I want to make sure we're approaching this in the most efficient way. You mentioned that you plan to add console.log statements to capture the runtime data. However, given that you already have a strong hypothesis about the cause and a solid proposed solution, would it be more efficient to implement the URL constructor approach directly and test whether it resolves the issue?

Think of it this way: you're already confident about what's causing the problem (URL concatenation with redundant slashes), and the URL constructor approach is inherently more robust than string manipulation. Rather than spending time trying to capture debug output that might not work cleanly in stdio mode, you could implement the fix and immediately test whether it resolves the create_page functionality.

**Understanding the Risk-Reward Tradeoff**

The debugging-first approach is methodologically sound and would give you complete certainty about the exact values being processed. However, it also adds complexity and potential delays, especially given the stdio output capture challenges you've encountered.

The implement-and-test approach is more pragmatic and likely to succeed quickly, but it means you're making the fix based on reasonable inference rather than confirmed data.

Given that your analysis is well-reasoned and the URL constructor approach is inherently safer than string concatenation, I'm inclined to suggest the latter approach. You can always add debugging afterward if the fix doesn't work as expected.

**My Recommendation**

Consider proceeding directly to implementing a clean solution using the URL constructor, wrapped in a utility function as you mentioned. This approach addresses the root cause systematically while avoiding the debugging complexities. You can always add logging later if needed, but there's a good chance this will resolve the issue immediately.

What's your thinking on this strategic choice? Do you feel more comfortable sticking with the debugging-first approach, or does the implement-and-test approach appeal to you given the robust nature of the URL constructor solution?
