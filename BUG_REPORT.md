To the developer of `mediawiki-mcp-server`,

I'm reporting a persistent bug related to malformed URLs in REST API requests, specifically the `create-page` tool, which is preventing successful communication with the MediaWiki API. I also propose a robust solution and explain my reasoning.

## Bug Report: Persistent Malformed URLs in REST API Requests

**Issue Description:**
The `mediawiki-mcp-server` is generating malformed URLs for REST API requests, characterized by the presence of double or even triple slashes (`//` or `///`) in the path segment. This issue prevents tools like `create-page` from successfully interacting with the MediaWiki API.

**Example of Malformed URL (observed after previous attempts to fix):**
`https://wiki.starfishenglish.com///rest.php/v1/page?uselang=ja`

**Expected URL:**
`https://wiki.starfishenglish.com/rest.php/v1/page?uselang=ja` (or with a single script path, e.g., `/w/rest.php/...`)

**Affected Components:**

- **Tool:** `create-page` (and likely all other tools making REST API requests)
- **File:** `src/common/utils.ts`
- **Functions:** `buildRestApiUrl`, `makeRestGetRequest`, `makeRestPutRequest`, `makeRestPostRequest`

**Observed Behavior:**
When attempting to use the `create-page` tool, the server constructs a URL with excessive slashes after the domain and before `rest.php`. This leads to `HTTP error!` messages and prevents the intended operation.

**Debugging Steps & Learnings:**

1.  **Initial `console.log` Debugging:** My first attempt involved adding `console.log` statements within `fetchCore` to inspect the constructed URL. However, due to the server running in `stdio` mode, the output was not reliably captured, making direct inspection difficult.
2.  **First `URL` Constructor Fix Attempt:** Based on the understanding that the `URL` constructor can help with path normalization, I introduced a `buildRestApiUrl` function that used `new URL(server)` and then manually concatenated `baseUrl.pathname`, `scriptPath()`, and `/rest.php`. While this seemed promising, it still resulted in malformed URLs (specifically, triple slashes in some cases) because the manual string concatenation within `buildRestApiUrl` did not fully account for all edge cases of leading/trailing slashes or empty `scriptPath` values. The `TS2552: Cannot find name 'response'` error was a red herring, likely caused by an incomplete `replace` operation during the initial fix attempt, and was resolved by restoring the `fetchCore` function.

The core problem lies in the concatenation logic within `buildRestApiUrl`, where combining `baseUrl.pathname`, `scriptPath`, and `/rest.php` can still lead to multiple slashes if not handled meticulously.

## Proposed Solution: Robust Path Joining with `joinPaths` Helper

To definitively resolve the malformed URL issue, I propose introducing a dedicated helper function, `joinPaths`, which will robustly combine URL path segments, ensuring proper normalization and preventing multiple slashes. The `buildRestApiUrl` function will then leverage this helper.

**Proposed Code Changes for `src/common/utils.ts`:**

```typescript
// New helper function to join path segments robustly
function joinPaths(...segments: string[]): string {
  return segments
    .map((segment) => segment.replace(/^\/|\/$/g, "")) // Remove leading/trailing slashes from each segment
    .filter((segment) => segment !== "") // Remove any empty segments
    .join("/"); // Join with a single slash
}

function buildRestApiUrl(server: string, sp: string, path: string): string {
  const baseUrl = new URL(server);
  const pathSegments: string[] = [];

  // Add the base URL's pathname, if it's not just '/'
  if (baseUrl.pathname && baseUrl.pathname !== "/") {
    pathSegments.push(baseUrl.pathname);
  }

  // Add the script path, if it exists
  if (sp) {
    pathSegments.push(sp);
  }

  // Add 'rest.php'
  pathSegments.push("rest.php");

  // Add the specific API path
  pathSegments.push(path);

  // Join all segments using the new helper and assign to baseUrl.pathname
  baseUrl.pathname = "/" + joinPaths(...pathSegments);

  return baseUrl.toString();
}
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

1.  **`joinPaths` Helper Function:**

    - This function takes an arbitrary number of string segments.
    - For each segment, it removes any leading or trailing slashes (`.replace( /^\/|\/$/g, '' )`). This ensures that each segment is "clean" before joining.
    - It filters out any segments that become empty after cleaning (`.filter( segment => segment !== '' )`). This prevents issues if `scriptPath()` returns an empty string, for example.
    - Finally, it joins the cleaned and filtered segments with a single slash (`.join( '/' )`). This guarantees that there will never be double slashes between segments.

2.  **Updated `buildRestApiUrl`:**
    - It initializes an array `pathSegments`.
    - It conditionally adds `baseUrl.pathname` (if not just `/`), `sp` (if present), `'rest.php'`, and the `path` to this array.
    - Crucially, it then uses `joinPaths( ...pathSegments )` to combine all these parts. The leading `/` is added separately to ensure the URL starts with a single slash after the domain.
    - This approach ensures that each component is treated as a distinct segment, and `joinPaths` handles the complexities of concatenation.

## Reasoning and Justification: Why this is the Best Solution

1.  **Robustness and Correctness:** This solution directly addresses the root cause of the malformed URLs: incorrect concatenation of path segments. The `joinPaths` helper is designed to handle all edge cases (leading/trailing slashes, empty intermediate segments) automatically and correctly. This provides a foolproof mechanism that will prevent recurrence of this bug.
2.  **Readability and Maintainability:** By encapsulating the complex path joining logic into a dedicated `joinPaths` function, the `buildRestApiUrl` function becomes much cleaner and easier to understand. It clearly shows the logical components of the URL being assembled, rather than being bogged down by intricate string manipulation. This improves the overall maintainability of the codebase.
3.  **Standard Practice:** Robust path joining utilities are a common and recommended pattern in software development, especially when dealing with URLs or file paths. This solution aligns with best practices for handling such operations.
4.  **Minimal and Targeted:** While one could consider pulling in a larger external URL utility library, for this specific problem, a small, custom `joinPaths` function is perfectly sufficient. It solves the problem effectively without introducing unnecessary external dependencies, which might come with their own overhead, security considerations, or compatibility issues. It's a minimal, targeted, and self-contained fix.
5.  **Leverages `URL` Constructor Effectively:** This solution still utilizes the native `URL` constructor for its benefits (e.g., handling the base URL, query parameters, etc.), but it augments it with a custom path joining logic where the `URL` constructor's `pathname` property alone might be insufficient or cumbersome to manage for complex concatenations.

## Devil's Advocate and Defense

**Objection 1: "This adds more code/complexity with a new `joinPaths` helper function. Why not just fix the existing concatenation directly?"**

**Defense:** While it introduces a new, small helper function, it _reduces_ the overall complexity and error-proneness of the URL construction logic. The current bug and the previous failed attempts clearly demonstrate that direct, manual string concatenation is highly susceptible to subtle errors related to leading/trailing slashes and empty segments. The `joinPaths` function abstracts away these intricate details, making the `buildRestApiUrl` function simpler and more declarative. The added code is highly reusable, self-contained, and significantly improves the robustness and maintainability of the URL generation. It's a small investment for a significant gain in reliability.

**Objection 2: "The `URL` constructor should be able to handle this. Why not just use its `pathname` property more carefully?"**

**Defense:** The `URL` constructor is excellent for parsing and manipulating URLs, but its `pathname` property, when directly assigned or concatenated, still requires careful handling of slashes, especially when combining multiple dynamic segments. As we've seen, even with careful manual attempts, subtle issues can lead to malformed URLs. `joinPaths` acts as a defensive layer. It ensures that the string assigned to `baseUrl.pathname` is always perfectly formed, regardless of the input segments. It's a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the real-world complexities of string manipulation and provides a foolproof mechanism.

**Objection 3: "What about performance overhead of calling `map`, `filter`, and `join` in `joinPaths`? Isn't direct string concatenation faster?"**

**Defense:** The performance overhead of these array operations on a few small string segments (typically 3-5 segments) is absolutely negligible in the context of a network request. The time taken for these operations will be orders of magnitude smaller than the network latency involved in making the actual API call. The benefits of correctness, robustness, and maintainability far outweigh any minuscule, practically unmeasurable performance impact. Prioritizing correctness and preventing recurring bugs is far more critical here than micro-optimizing string operations.

I am confident that this proposed solution provides a robust, maintainable, and correct fix for the malformed URL bug. I am ready to implement this change and verify it thoroughly.
